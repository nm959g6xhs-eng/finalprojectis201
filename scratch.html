                Welcome to The Smoking Jacket.
                This is not a feed. It is not a chart. It is not an algorithm shouting at you about what you should like next.
                <br>
                This is a room.
                <br>
                Imagine an old study at the far end of a quiet house. The lights are low. A fire settles into its rhythm rather than roaring for attention. A bear rug bears the honorable scuffs of a long life. There is one chair that matters, oversized, red, and unapologetically indulgent. You sink into it not to escape the world, but to listen to it more carefully.
                <br>
                That is the spirit of The Smoking Jacket.
                <br>
                Here, music is not background noise for productivity. It is conversation. It is history. It is argument and romance and memory, sometimes all in the same song. We care about where music has been, where it is now, and what it is becoming in an age where attention is scarce and taste is outsourced.
                <br>
                You’ll find reflections on the state of music as it exists today, stripped of hype and handled with respect. You’ll find tools that help you understand what you’re hearing, including an AI that can identify and explain the genre of any song, not as a label, but as a lineage. And when the evening turns competitive, you’ll find an AI-powered arena for aux battles, where taste is tested, defended, and occasionally humiliated in good humor.
                <br>
                This is a place for listening closely. For arguing well. For discovering something you didn’t know you loved.
                <br>
                So take the chair. Let the fire settle. Put on a record.
                <br>
                You’re among friends now.

  <h2 class="subsection-title">History</h2>

  <p class="content-paragraph">
    The Smoking Jacket did not begin as a “brand.” It began as a mild disagreement over a playlist that turned into a full-scale philosophical crisis.
    In an era where algorithms confidently suggest songs you didn’t ask for (and then act offended when you skip them), a small group of listeners
    gathered in a place of safety: an overly decorated study with a crackling fireplace, a bear rug of questionable legality, and one enormous red chair
    reserved for anyone brave enough to say, “Actually… I have thoughts about this track.”
  </p>

  <p class="content-paragraph">
    We were not anti-technology. We were anti-being-bossed-around-by-technology. So we did the only reasonable thing: we recruited it.
    The result is a clubhouse where music is treated like an art form again—heard on purpose, discussed without shame, and occasionally defended in
    honorable combat during aux battles.
  </p>

  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Over time, our operation expanded. Articles were curated. Opinions were politely sharpened. Tools were built.
    One AI helps identify the genre of any song (with fewer vibes-based lies). Another orchestrates aux battle tournaments, where friendships
    are tested and the phrase “you can’t play that third” is taken very seriously.
  </p>

  <p class="content-paragraph">
    Today, The Smoking Jacket remains what it has always been: a secret society hiding in plain sight, dedicated to music, good taste,
    and the radical belief that you should sometimes listen to an entire album all the way through like a civilized person.
